Welcome to my research website! I am an Associate Professor at the Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU), CHINA. My research focuses on the development and usage of modern space geodetic and remote sensing techniques to measure surface deformation on the Earth. The techniques I used include, but not limited to, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and optical image cross correlation. Specifically I am interested in studying the deformation processes induced by geohazards such as earthquakes, magma transports, glacier movements, and mountain permafrost creep. Combing with data from field surveying and numerical modeling, my research aims at understanding better the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed deformation and helping the assessment, prevention, and mitigation of geohazards.
